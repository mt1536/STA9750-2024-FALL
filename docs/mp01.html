<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a small project in which I explore data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a> with the objective of finding facts and insights from the data. Instructions and further details provided by my professor Mr.&nbsp;Michael Weylandt, Ph.D can be found <a href="https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini01.html">here</a>. We will be using data such as farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source.</p>
<section id="preparing-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h2>
<p>To start with the project, I used the following code to download the data. Here we can see some tables being created with specific columns, then these new tables are joined.</p>

<p>Q4.1 Which Agency has the most VRM per UPT? I chose this question because I believe this shows how efficiently an agency is using its resources. A lower Vehicle Revenue Miles to Unlinked Passenger Trips ratio would show that an Agency is able to maximize the usage of its vehicles in relation to the number of passanger trips. In this case the most efficient based on the previously mentioned definition would be New York City Department of Transportation with a ratio of .00942. However, this needs deeper analysis to determine its implications and flaws</p>

<p>Note I did not restrict data to major transit systems because I was interested in seeing the results despite the size of the transit system</p>
<p>Q1. Which transit system (agency and mode) had the most UPT in 2022? The transit system with the most UPT in 2022 was the MTA New York City Transit</p>

<p>Q2. Which transit system (agency and mode) had the highest farebox recovery, defined as the highest ratio of Total Fares to Expenses?</p>
<p>The Agency Transit Authority of Central Kentucky with the mode of Vanpool had the highest farebox recovery. This indicates that this agency was able to obtain more revenue relative to its expenses in comparison to other Agencies. It its interesting to see that Vanpool occupies the second and third place in this query. This might indicate that this is Mode of transportation is financially efficient</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Q3. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per UPT?</p>
<p>North Carolina State Universityâ€™s Bus transportation had the lowest expenses per UPT. This seems to be a transit system focusing on transportation for a university, so it might be that the low expenses derive from the relative short range of the service provided</p>

<p>Q5. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per VRM?</p>
<p>New Mexico Department of Transportation Vanpool mode had the lowest expense per VRM. That same mode is in the next 4 spots of our results. This indicates that Vanpool could be transportation mode that does not require or demands a lot of expenses.</p>

<p>Q6. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per VRM?</p>
<p>Chicago Water Taxi (Wendella) Ferryboat transportation had the highest total fares per VRM. This might reflect the fact that expenses and mainteinance for this mode of transportation is higher</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Farebox recovery rate for the Transit Authority of Central Kentucky, and more specifically the Vanpool mode seems to be great. There should be a deeper investigation into why this is, and how this transportation mode can be escalated to serve more people, or how Vanpool transportation modeâ€™s characteristics can be leveraged for other transportation modes to achieve such recovery rates</p>
