How much did NYC subway ridership fall between April 2019 and April 2020? NYC subway ridership fell by approximately 91 during the dates indicated.

I chose this question because I believe this shows how efficiently an agency is using its resources. A lower Vehicle Revenue Miles to Unlinked Passenger Trips ratio would show that an Agency is able to maximize the usage of its vehicles in relation to the number of passanger trips. In this case the most efficient based on the previously mentioned definition would be New York City Department of Transportation with a ratio of .00942. However, this needs deeper analysis to determine its implications and flaws\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nvrm_per_upt &lt;- USAGE |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency) |&gt;\n  summarise(UPT_Total = sum(UPT), VRM_Total = sum(VRM), VRM_per_UPT_ratio = (VRM_Total/UPT_Total)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(VRM_per_UPT_ratio) |&gt;\n  head(5)\n\nprint(vrm_per_upt)\n\nQ4.2 What is the most used mode per metro area?

Which transit system (agency and mode) had the most UPT in 2022? The transit system with the most UPT in 2022 was the MTA New York City Transit\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nUSAGE_2022_ANNUAL |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(UPT_Total)) |&gt;\n  head(5) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nQ2. Which transit system (agency and mode) had the highest farebox recovery, defined as the highest ratio of Total Fares to Expenses?\nThe Agency Transit Authority of Central Kentucky with the mode of Vanpool had the highest farebox recovery. This indicates that this agency was able to obtain more revenue relative to its expenses in comparison to other Agencies. It its interesting to see that Vanpool occupies the second and third place in this query. This might indicate that this is Mode of transportation is financially efficient\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nhighest_farebox_recovery &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarise(ratio = (sum(`Total Fares`, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(Expenses, na.rm = TRUE))) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(ratio)) |&gt;\n  head(5)\n\nprint(highest_farebox_recovery)\n\nQ3. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per UPT?\nNorth Carolina State University’s Bus transportation had the lowest expenses per UPT. This seems to be a transit system focusing on transportation for a university, so it might be that the low expenses derive from the relative short range of the service provided\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlowest_expenses_per_UPT &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarise(ratio = (sum(Expenses, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(UPT_Total, na.rm = TRUE)),.groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(ratio) |&gt;\n  head(5)\nprint(lowest_expenses_per_UPT)\n\nQ4. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per UPT?\nThe Altoona Metro Transit Demand Response transportation had the highest total fares per UPT\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nhighest_total_fares_per_UPT &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarise(ratio = (sum(`Total Fares`, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(UPT_Total, na.rm = TRUE)),.groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(ratio)) |&gt;\n  head(5)\nprint(highest_total_fares_per_UPT) \n\nQ5. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the lowest expenses per VRM?\nNew Mexico Department of Transportation Vanpool mode had the lowest expense per VRM. That same mode is in the next 4 spots of our results. This indicates that Vanpool could be transportation mode that does not require or demands a lot of expenses.\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlowest_expenses_per_VRM &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarise(ratio = (sum(Expenses, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(VRM_Total, na.rm = TRUE)),.groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(ratio) |&gt;\n  head(5)\nprint(lowest_expenses_per_VRM)\n\nQ6. Which transit system (agency and mode) has the highest total fares per VRM?\nChicago Water Taxi (Wendella) Ferryboat transportation had the highest total fares per VRM. This might reflect the fact that expenses and mainteinance for this mode of transportation is higher\n{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nhighest_fares_per_VRM &lt;- USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS |&gt;\n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt;\n  summarise(ratio = (sum(`Total Fares`, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(VRM_Total, na.rm = TRUE)),.groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(ratio)) |&gt;\n  head(5)\nprint(highest_fares_per_VRM)\n\n##Conclusion Farebox recovery rate for the Transit Authority of Central Kentucky, and more specifically the Vanpool mode seems to be great. There should be a deeper investigation into why this is, and how this transportation mode can be escalated to serve more people, or how Vanpool transportation mode’s characteristics can be leveraged for other transportation modes to achieve such recovery rates"
