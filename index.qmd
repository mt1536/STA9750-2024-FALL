title: MY DREAMS
---

Everyone has a dream...or at least most people have one. These are some of the dreams I have:\

-   Buying a house
-   Buying a car
-   Finding a great job
-   Traveling to many countries\

In order to achieve these dreams I have taken the following actions:\

1.  Start a MS in Statistics
2.  Save and invest
3.  Read every day
4.  Learn a new language
5.  Learn Python
6.  Work on communication skills\

Sometimes, I need a little motivation. So I look at pictures such as this one from Porche's web site:\\
